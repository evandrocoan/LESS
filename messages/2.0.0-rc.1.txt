LESS 2.0.0 Pre-release
======================

Less for Sublime Text has been updated! It now finally supports things like
flex-box syntax and it's in line with the scope naming guidelines for Sublime
Text 3.0.

A lot of changes were made to get to this point and we were able to close
a lot of issues. If something doesn't work for you let us know at:
